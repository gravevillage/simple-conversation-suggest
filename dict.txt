How have you been recently? We moved to Asakusa.
I will show you around next time you come to Japan.
I am going to New York on business next month.
I was wondering if you could tell me about your new patent.
I will be in New York from 15th to 20th.
I have afternoon free on 17th and 19th.
Please let me know if you are available on either day.
Please also let me know when is good for you, if you are not available on those days.
